With more than twenty years of experience, we can build a delegated authority audit process that gives you the comfort you need without impairing the relationship with your partners.

We complete a broad range of audits of Coverholders and Delegated Claims Administrators for Lloyd’s, insurer and reinsurer clients.

Many of our clients request the use of common audit scopes adopted by the Lloyd’s market however, we would always discuss your needs and build a bespoke scope that ensures we meet all general and audit specific requirements.

We are very conscious of costs and provide a fixed price based upon the prescribed scope. We also individually discuss remote or onsite options and provide an estimate of the associated travel and subsistence costs.
